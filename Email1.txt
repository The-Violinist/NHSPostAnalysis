Email Subject: IT-Service desk: Covid-19 notice for all employees 

Dear Staff, 

There has been an ongoing outbreak of a deadly virus called the Coronavirus (Covid-19). The virus is spreading extremely quickly and the World Health Organization is doing everything possible to contain the situation. The government has instructed all organizations and institutions to educate and teach all employees and staff about the virus in order to increase awareness of how to prevent the spread of Covid-19. 

We are currently organizing a seminar for all employees and staff to learn more about the virus. All employees and staff are asked to quickly respond to a quick survey to show your awareness about Covid-19 and to also register for the seminar. The survey and the seminar is mandatory for all employees and staff to participate in immediately when you receive this notice or disciplinary measure will be taken on all employees and staff that fail to carry out this instruction. 

Please follow this link to complete the survey and register for the seminar. < hyperlink to survey and seminar >

Thank you for your cooperation, 
IT-Service Desk
