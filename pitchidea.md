Idea Pitches:

NHS: 
Summary: Identify vulnerable targets. Deliver phishing scam email to execute payload. Payload will encrypt ransomware and try to spread to
other machines on the network.Hardening the environment to withstand and recover from a ransomware attack. Mitigate vulnerabilities to prevent injection of ransomware.

Pain Point:
Unpatched Windows 7
Wannacry
Unmonitored network

MVP:
Attacking vulnerability
Exploitation of windows 7
Deliver Ransomware
Detection: Set up monitoring solution
Prevent: Stop delivery
