# Attack Overview
On May 12, 2017 a global ransomware attack, known as WannaCry, affected more than 200,000 computers in more than 100 countries. In the United Kingdom the WannaCry attack affected the National Health Service (NHS), although it was not the specific target. The NHS declared the cyber attack a major incident and implemented its emergency arrangements to be able to maintain health and patient care. On the same day, a cybersecurity researcher found and activated a kill-switch so that WannaCry stopped encrypting and locking devices that evening.

# Synopsis
The WannaCry cyber attack was one of the largest cyber attacks to affect the National Health Service in the United Kingdom (NHS). WannaCry further infected 603 primary care and other NHS organizations, including 595 General Practitioner practices. NHS believes that no patient data was compromised or stolen during the WannaCry ransomware attack. 

The NHS was warned about the possible risks of cyber attacks on the computer software. The Department and Cabinet Office wrote to trusts in 2014, informing them that it was essential to move away from old software such as Windows 7 by 2015. In March and April of 2017, the NHS had issued critical alerts warning organizations to patch their systems to prevent WannaCry. 

Twenty of the 25 infected trusts were able to continue to treat urgent and emergency patients over the weekend but five had to divert patients to other emergency and accident departments. The recovery was assisted by the work of the cybersecurity researcher that found and activated the kill-switch that stopped WannaCry from spreading.
