Group Project: Team Agreement
Team members: Jeff Snyder, David Armstrong, Kimberly Dills

October 2020

Communication plan:

We will communicate using slack messages, and working in remo. We want to make sure that we create a supportive environment that everyone feels safe to communicate openly without judgement. We will make sure to ask what each other thinks or feels about an idea and that we understand each other. We have discussed with each other the importance of feeling free to ask for clarification on any issues at any time. We will have a top of day and end of day meeting to reflect on what we have completed and what needs to be completed. 

Conflict plan:
We will communicate with each other respectfully, listen with an open mind and review any issues with constructive feedback, agree on a solution and move forward. 
Should a conflict arise:
It will be addressed on an individual basis and be discussed between the affected parties.
If the conflict is not resolved, the discussion will be elevated to the group level
A meeting will be set to discuss the issue and attempt to find a solution.
If a resolution is not agreed upon by all members of the group, we will take a vote on the matter, taking into consideration:
The relevance of the subject to the overall product
Effect on the group progress overall
If the conflict does not get resolved within our group, we will then be sure to mention it to one of the Codefellows staff department.

Work plan:

We will be meeting each day in Remo from 9AM-6PM and deciding on what the objective will be for the day and then dive into more details about the objective. We will convene at the completion of each task to make sure we are on the same page moving forward according to the completion of our project.  Tasks will be discussed in a verbal discussion within the requirements of the project. Monday will be used as our project management tool and will be a way for team members to make contributions and to track the progress of the project.

Git process: We will use github for our repository for any of our code that we use for our project.

Any thing else you feel is important:

After hours communication will be available but not expected. Group members are welcome to send messages after hours, but a response is not mandatory after hours.
